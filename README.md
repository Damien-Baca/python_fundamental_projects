## Dice Rolling Game
### The Goal
The goal for this project is to create a simple game where the user can roll two dice repeatedly until deciding to exit. Sample output shown below.

As an extra challenge:
- It should be possible to change how many dice are rolled and how many sides the dice have.
- Add a counter that keeps track of how many times the dice were rolled.
### Sample Output
```
> python dice_rolling_game.py
Roll the dice? (y/n): a
