## Dice Rolling Game
### Prompt
The goal for this project is to create a simple game where the user can roll two dice repeatedly until deciding to exit. Sample output shown below.

As an additional challenge:
- It should be possible to change how many dice are rolled and how many sides the dice have.
- Add a counter that keeps track of how many times the dice were rolled.
### Sample Output
```
Roll the dice? (y/n): a
Invalid Choice!
Roll the dice? (y/n): b
Invalid Choice!
Roll the dice? (y/n): y
(5, 2)
Roll the dice? (y/n): Y
(1, 4)
Roll the dice? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
```


## Number Guessing Game
### Prompt
The goal of this game is to guess a number randomly generated by the program. The number should be between 1 and 100. If the user's guess is not a number an error should be printed. If the number is too low or too high the user should be given a corresponding message telling them so. When the number is correctly guessed print a congratulatory message and end the program.

As an additional challenge:
- It should be possible to change the range of the random number.
- Program should support negative numbers.

### Sample Output
```
Guess the number between 1 and 100: a
Please enter a valid number
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 50
Too high!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 25
Too high!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 10
Too high!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 5
Too low!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 7
Too low!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 8
Congratulations! You guessed the number.
```

### Pseudo-code
```python
    # Generate random target number
    # Loop until break
        # Display prompt and get the user's guess

        # Check that it is a valid number
            # If not display error and continue

        # If the guess was correct
            # Congratulate and exit loop

        # If guess is greater than target
            # Tell the user their guess was too high.
        
        # If guess is less than target
            # Tell the user their guess was too low.
```

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Prompt
The goal for this project is to implement a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors on the command line. The user goes first and picks one of the three plays, rock, paper, or scissors. The program will then choose its play randomly and the result of the game will be printed to the console. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

As an additional challenge:
- Include the emojis in the output
- Modularize the program into functions

### Sample Output
```
Rock, paper, or scissors? (r/p/s): a
Invalid choice!
Rock, paper, or scissors? (r/p/s): r
You chose rock ✊
Computer chose paper ✋
You lose
Continue? (y/n): y
Rock, paper, or scissors? (r/p/s): s
You chose scissors ✌
Computer chose paper ✋
You win
Continue? (y/n): n
```

### Pseudo-code
```Python
    # Loop until break - Main Loop
        # Display "game" prompt and get the users selection

        # If users selection is not valid
            # Display Invalid message
            # Jump to "Main Loop"
        
        # Randomly generate computers selection

        # Print users selection
        # Print computers selection
        # Print result of the game

        # Loop until break - Continue Loop
            # Display "continue" prompt and get users selection
            # If users selection is valid
                # break
            # Display Invalid message
        
        # If user does not wish to continue
            # exit loop
```

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Prompt
The goal for this project is to implement a game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the pygame library. Unlike the previous game tic-tac-toe should be implemented away from the command line as a 2D graphical application. The game should allow a multiplayer game. That is, two users (X's and O'x) should be able to take turns on one machine to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe ending in either a victory for one of the players or a Tie. The game should also allow for the user to continue playing after each game and keep a running score between player 1 and player 2 until the user decides to start a brand new game.

As an additional challenge:
- Include a single-player mode that implements a rudimentary AI for the player to play against rather than another human player.
