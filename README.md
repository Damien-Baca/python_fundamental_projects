# Python Fundamental Projects

## Dice Rolling Game
### The Goal
The goal for this project is to create a simple game where the user can roll two dice repeatedly until deciding to exit. Sample output shown below.

As an extra challenge:
- It should be possible to change how many dice are rolled and how many sides the dice have.
- Add a counter that keeps track of how many times the dice were rolled.
### Sample Output
```
> python dice_rolling_game.py
Roll the dice? (y/n): a
Invalid Choice!
Roll the dice? (y/n): b
Invalid Choice!
Roll the dice? (y/n): y
(5, 2)
Roll the dice? (y/n): Y
(1, 4)
Roll the dice? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
```


## Number Guessing Game
### Prompt
The goal of this game is to guess a number randomy generated by the program. The number should be between 1 and 100. If the user's guess is not a number an error should be printed. If the number is too low or too high the user should be given a corresponding message telling them so. When the number is correctly guessed print a congragulatory message and end the program.

### Sample Output
```
Guess the number between 1 and 100: a
Please enter a valid number
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 50
Too high!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 25
Too high!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 10
Too high!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 5
Too low!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 7
Too low!
Guess the number between 1 and 100: 8
Congratulations! You guessed the number.
